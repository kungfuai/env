<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repo aims to be a cloud and local compatible approach to modern application environment handling.

Environment files committed with the repo bring us some clear advantages that we should consider
when building software.

At KUNGFU.AI, many of our usecases are single container microservice deployment into a cloud. By committing secrets to
cloud Secret Manager, and keeping Secret IDs + other environment data within our env files, we're able to:

1. Keep our deployed assets secure
2. Developers don't have to pass keys, know about keys, or share env files (YUCK)
3. Developers can pull and run their repos immediately.

The kungfuai/env repo aims to simplify the above usecases.

### Dependencies
Python 3.8

### Installation

`pip install https://github.com/kungfuai/env.git`
